    <!-- this is the parent changeset. for cleanliness and consistency sake, please DO NOT
        put single changesets here. Put them in chronologically named changesets instead.

        E.g. "03-2013-changeset.xml" will contain all ddls made during the month of 3/2013.
         Then core-changeset.xml will import this file via this line:  "include file="03-2013-changeset.xml" -->

    <!--
       REMINDERS:
       *DO NOT DELETE/ALTER any declared changesets (including their corresponding SQL files).
       If you want to correct any wrong changesets committed, MAKE A NEW CHANGESET to correct
       your previous one.
       *Liquibase cannot process comments found in sql files. They are read and run as well.
